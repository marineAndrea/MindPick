Rick likes reading articles on his spare time and is has been using this app for two things
first he was looking for a way to store, filter and sort all the articles that he reads and care about in an easy way
but also, he is the kind of person who likes to be challenged in his positions, he is open to learn knew stuff, and tries to ajust his beliefs and behaviour according to new facts that he becomes aware of.
So let's see how Rick uses this app.
He first signs in and get to his profile.
Here we can see that Rick is interested in science innovation and politics, pretty general
So Rick just read this article on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that he found particularly interesting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He wants to be able to come back to it any time so he adds it to his profile
He provides the url !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and a tag to describe it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We see that it is automatically added to the list of articles and that he can retrieve it easily by providing the topic or the name of the journal or sorting by date for example
So we see anyway that because this article is not very popular for now, Rick must have been the first user to have added it.
But some other articles that Rick have added (CLICK ON ADDED) seem to have become popular.
This one is an artilce on Google's smart contact lens. As Rick has diabeted, he was quite excited by this innovatiom.
Rick is curious to explore related articles to this one so he clicks on the link and get to the article's page *******change size of display******


^^^^^^^^^^Rick remembers that he had some doubts about how well funded this article is, so he looks at the related articles.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


These related articles have been added by other users who provided links to related articles that potentially support or undermine the main article.


^^^^^^^^So Rick is curious to know more about what articles that undermines this article on !!!!!!!!!!!
So he CLICKS ON UNDERMINING ARTICLES and choose one that seems well supported based on the color of the font (green means well supported as opposed to red for underming related articles) and that seems also seems uncontroversial (you can see the controversy index is low here).
So HE CLICKS ON THE LINK and get to this article's page
And here he reads the article and learns a lot about !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!^^^^^^^^^^^^
He may continue his journey by reading other related sources, caus' he just got aware about problems with the patent system may start caring about it.

It's another day, a sunday maybe. Rick has time and want to read some new article, but he needs some guidance to choose
So he could go on the articles page that displays a list of all the articles, that he can filter by topic (ENTER LETTERS), popularity (SORT BY POP IDX), or controversy (SORT BY CONTROVERSY), or by nmost recently added (SORT DATE).
Now another option offered to Rick, and the one he prefers is to choose an article by visualizing how the articles available relate to each other.
So he goes to the network's page and HOVERS on the nodes, the big ones especially and he sees this tag which seems interesting to him, it says WATER FOOTPRINT
Now he uses the search bar and types water. This search shows a subset of articles related to the topic.
He sees drought water restrictions California and clicks on this to see where the corresponding node is. That's great it seems to be a popular article, not really controversial because the node is blue (the size indicates the popularity and the color from green to red)how controversial the article is). Also it has some related other articles associated to it which is cool because it's Sunday and Rick has some time in front of him. So he decides to look at the article.

^^^^^^^^This article is about DROUGHT AND WATER RESTRICTIONS (HOVER) and Rick sees also that it has a lot of connexions, which is cool, because it is Sunday and Rick has a lot of time and really wants to know more about the topic.^^^^^^^^^

He right-clicks and gets to the article's page.
He reads the article. It is about California's water restrictions and reducing the average time of our showers and that is funny because Rick had already changed his habits and stopped taking baths for a while now because he thinks this is a habit that is unsustainable if everybody does it regularly. 
So although he is not an expert on the question, he believes based on his this article and things he has heard that this article is right, and therefore he decides to give a positive opinion on it.
So HE SELECTS WELL SUPPORTED, but because he has no source to ground his opinion, he does not provide any related article in this case. Otherwise, he would have added it to his post. He could also have provided a related source that neither supports or undermines the article.
This post leads him back to his profile and he can see the article he has just commented on, added to his list.
He notices that it is highlighted, which means that there is some dissonance between his jugement and the opinion reflected by the community.
This article was somewhat controversial and we can confirm this by looking at the controversy index associated to it. But the font is also red, which mean that overall it tends to be not supported.
So he goes back to the view, filter again with the same topic, find the node, and looks for well supported articles (the green ones) that point toward this article. HE CLICKS on one of them.
Now after reading this new article he learns for example that the total amount of water needed to produce one pound of beef is about 18 hundred gallons of water (more than 2 weeks of showers), and realizes that as he was trying not to wate water, he might as well start by changing his eating habits and maybe think about becoming a vegetarian.
